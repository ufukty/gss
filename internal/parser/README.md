# Parsers

Although there are 3 parsers here the project reads only 2 different type of files. The 3rd parser is for Gsse (Gss Expressions). Gsse parser runs per-expression during one execution of Gss parser as property values are processed. Thus, the return values of Gsse parser is placed into the Gss Ast by Gss parser.
