# Dimensional

## Maintenance note

Dimensional is designed to be unaware of contextual information that is needed to resolve written length, angle etc. values to canvas values in order to avoid circular dependency issues. This way gss expressions can be parsed during gss parsing which is earlier than dom involve.
